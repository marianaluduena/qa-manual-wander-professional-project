# qa-manual-wander-professional-project
Here is all my work as QA Manual in my first professional IT training programm in Igrowker 

### Summary: 📚

During this project I worked in a multicultural team to build **Wander**, a touristic web app. I worked doing manual testing in the frontend, and manual and automation testing in the backend with **Postman.**

My **greatest challenge** was to learn **how to write API test cases and exploratory testing reports post regression testing** . So I learn all of it by using the help of **ChatGPT** just for **ideas and guidance**, but **never by doing copy-paste.**
